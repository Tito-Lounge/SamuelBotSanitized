# SamuelBotSanitized
A sanitized version of Samuel Bot; a joke-bot meant to imitate a friend of mine.\
The bot uses the discordpy API and was a project to get me to learn basic Python syntax and structure. Samuel Bot will take a message, see if there are any special key phrases to initiate an inside joke, and select randomly from them.
All jokes are told in jest and good faith.
## To Use
1. Create a python virtual environment in which to install the textblob and discord.py libraries
2. Place your discord bot token in a file called config.py. Set as variable 'token'
